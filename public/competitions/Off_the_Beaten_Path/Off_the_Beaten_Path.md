## Abstract

The "Off the Beaten Path" competition is an optimization challenge where participants must build an algorithm to maximize profit by sending workers to collect rewards within a given time and budget.

My approach to this challenge was to create a custom suboptimal Branch and Bound algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with multiple agents.
